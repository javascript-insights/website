  <h2>What c</h2>
  <h3>Complex Animations:</h3>
  <p>Add more complex animations to simulate real-world scenarios.</p>
  <p>Example: A bouncing ball, rotating elements, or a sliding carousel.</p>

  <h3>Network Requests:</h3>
  <p>Simulate different types of network requests (e.g., GET, POST) with varying response times.</p>
  <p>Example: Fetching data from multiple APIs or simulating slow network conditions.</p>

  <h3>User Interactions:</h3>
  <p>Include interactive elements like forms, buttons, and sliders.</p>
  <p>Example: A form submission that triggers a network request and updates the DOM.</p>

  <h3>Dynamic Content:</h3>
  <p>Load content dynamically using JavaScript.</p>
  <p>Example: Infinite scrolling or lazy loading images.</p>

  <h3>Heavy Computation:</h3>
  <p>Add JavaScript functions that perform heavy computations to simulate CPU-intensive tasks.</p>
  <p>Example: Calculating Fibonacci numbers or sorting large arrays.</p>

  <h3>Event Listeners:</h3>
  <p>Attach multiple event listeners to elements to track user interactions.</p>
  <p>Example: Mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard events.</p>

  <h2>Instructions for Participants</h2>
  <h3>Analyze Complex Animations:</h3>
  <p>Use the Performance tool to record and analyze the complex animations.</p>
  <p>Identify any performance bottlenecks.</p>

  <h3>Monitor Network Requests:</h3>
  <p>Record the performance while fetching data.</p>
  <p>Analyze the network request timings and their impact on performance.</p>

  <h3>Evaluate Heavy Computation:</h3>
  <p>Perform the heavy computation task and record the performance.</p>
  <p>Check the CPU usage and identify any performance issues.</p>

  <h3>Track User Interactions:</h3>
  <p>Use the Performance tool to record mouse movements and other interactions.</p>
  <p>Analyze the event log to see how interactions affect performance.</p>


  <h2>Performance Tool Sections</h2>
  <h3>Summary:</h3>
  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Summary section provides a high-level overview of the performance recording. It
    includes key metrics such as total time, CPU usage, and memory usage.</p>
  <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This section helps you quickly identify major performance issues and understand the
    overall performance characteristics of your page.</p>

  <h3>Bottom-Up:</h3>
  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Bottom-Up section shows the time spent in each function, starting from the bottom of
    the call stack. It aggregates the time spent in each function across all calls.</p>
  <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This view helps you identify which functions are consuming the most time, allowing you to
    focus on optimizing the most time-consuming parts of your code.</p>

  <h3>Call Tree:</h3>
  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Call Tree section displays a hierarchical view of the call stack, showing how
    functions call each other. It breaks down the time spent in each function, including both self-time (time spent in
    the function itself) and total time (time spent in the function and its children).</p>
  <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This view helps you understand the structure of your code execution and identify which
    parts of the call stack are contributing most to performance issues.</p>

  <h3>Event Log:</h3>
  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Event Log section lists all events that occurred during the recording in
    chronological order. This includes network requests, DOM events, and JavaScript execution.</p>
  <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This view helps you trace the sequence of events and understand the timing and order of
    operations that affect your page's performance.</p>

  <h2>Activity Types</h2>
  <h3>Loading Events:</h3>
