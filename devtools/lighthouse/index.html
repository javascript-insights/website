  <p>This website is designed to help you understand and utilize the capabilities of the Lighthouse DevTool. Lighthouse
    is an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. You can use it to audit performance,
    accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO, and more.</p>
  <p>Throughout this course, we will explore various features of Lighthouse and demonstrate how to use them to enhance
    your web development skills. Each section will provide theoretical insights and hands-on exercises to ensure you
    gain practical experience.</p>

    <h2>User Flows in Lighthouse</h2>
    <p>Historically, Lighthouse has analyzed the cold pageload of a page. Starting in 2022 (Lighthouse v10), it can analyze and report on the entire page lifecycle via "user flows".</p>
    <p>You might be interested in flows ifâ€¦</p>
    <ul>
      <li>â€¦ you want to run Lighthouse on your whole webapp, not just the landing page.</li>
      <li>â€¦ you want to know if all parts of the web experience are accessible (e.g. a checkout process).</li>
      <li>â€¦ you want to know the Cumulative Layout Shift of my SPA page transition</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In these cases, you want Lighthouse on a flow, not just a page load.</p>

    <h3>The three modes: Navigation, Timespan, Snapshot</h3>
    <p>Lighthouse can now run in three modes: navigations, timespans, and snapshots. Each mode has its own unique use cases, benefits, and limitations. Later, you'll create a flow by combining these three core report types.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Navigation mode</strong> analyzes a single page load. It should feel familiar as all Lighthouse runs prior to v9.6.0 were essentially in this mode. Even in v9.6.0 and onwards, it remains the default.</li>
      <li><strong>Timespan mode</strong> analyzes an arbitrary period of time, typically containing user interactions.</li>
      <li><strong>Snapshot mode</strong> analyzes the page in a particular state.</li>
    </ul>
