  <p>This website is designed to help you understand and utilize the capabilities of the Lighthouse DevTool. Lighthouse
    is an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. You can use it to audit performance,
    accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO, and more.</p>
  <p>Throughout this course, we will explore various features of Lighthouse and demonstrate how to use them to enhance
    your web development skills. Each section will provide theoretical insights and hands-on exercises to ensure you
    gain practical experience.</p>

  <h2>User Flows in Lighthouse</h2>
  <p>Historically, Lighthouse has analyzed the cold pageload of a page. Starting in 2022 (Lighthouse v10), it can
    analyze and report on the entire page lifecycle via "user flows".</p>
  <p>You might be interested in flows ifâ€¦</p>
  <ul>
    <li>â€¦ you want to run Lighthouse on your whole webapp, not just the landing page.</li>
    <li>â€¦ you want to know if all parts of the web experience are accessible (e.g. a checkout process).</li>
    <li>â€¦ you want to know the Cumulative Layout Shift of my SPA page transition</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In these cases, you want Lighthouse on a flow, not just a page load.</p>

  <h3>The three modes: Navigation, Timespan, Snapshot</h3>
  <p>Lighthouse can now run in three modes: navigations, timespans, and snapshots. Each mode has its own unique use
    cases, benefits, and limitations. Later, you'll create a flow by combining these three core report types.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Navigation mode</strong> analyzes a single page load. It should feel familiar as all Lighthouse runs
      prior to v9.6.0 were essentially in this mode. Even in v9.6.0 and onwards, it remains the default.</li>
    <li><strong>Timespan mode</strong> analyzes an arbitrary period of time, typically containing user interactions.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Snapshot mode</strong> analyzes the page in a particular state.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Web Vitals</h1>
  <p>Web Vitals is an initiative by Google to provide unified guidance for quality signals that are essential to
    delivering a great user experience on the web.</p>
  <p>The Web Vitals initiative aims to simplify the landscape, and help sites focus on the metrics that matter most, the
    Core Web Vitals.</p>
  <h2>Core Web Vitals</h2>
  <p>Core Web Vitals are the subset of Web Vitals that apply to all web pages, should be measured by all site owners,
    and will be surfaced across all devtools. Each of the Core Web Vitals represents a distinct facet of the user
    experience, is measurable in the field, and reflects the real-world experience of a critical user-centric outcome.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)</strong>: Measures loading performance. A good LCP should occur within
      2.5 seconds of when the page starts loading.</li>
    <li><strong>Interaction to Next Paint (INP)</strong>: Measures interactivity. A good INP should be 200 milliseconds
      or less.</li>
    <li><strong>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</strong>: Measures visual stability. A good CLS should be 0.1 or less.
    </li>
    <li><strong>First Contentful Paint (FCP)</strong>: Measures loading performance. A good FCP should occur within 1
      second of when the page starts loading.</li>
    <li><strong>First Meaningful Paint (FMP)</strong>: Measures loading performance. A good FMP should occur within 1
      second of when the page starts loading.</li>
    <li><strong>Speed Index (SI)</strong>: Measures loading performance. A good SI should be 3.4 seconds or less.</li>
    <li><strong>Time to Interactive (TTI)</strong>: Measures interactivity. A good TTI should be 5 seconds or less.</li>
    <li><strong>First Paint (FP)</strong>: Measures loading performance. A good FP should occur within 1 second of when
      the page starts loading.</li>
    <li><strong>First Interactive (FI)</strong>: Measures interactivity. A good FI should be 5 seconds or less.</li>
    <li><strong>Total Blocking Time</strong>: Measures the total amount of time that a user is blocked from interacting
      with the page. A good TBT should be 300 milliseconds or less.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To ensure you're hitting the recommended target for these metrics for most of your users, a good threshold to
    measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices.</p>
