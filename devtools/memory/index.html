    <h2>Memory Tool</h2>
    <p>The Memory tool in DevTools helps you understand memory usage and find memory leaks in your web applications. It
      provides insights into how memory is allocated and retained, allowing you to optimize your application's
      performance.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A page's performance gets progressively worse over time. This is possibly a symptom of a memory leak. A
        memory
        leak is when a bug in the page causes the page to progressively use more and more memory over time.</li>
      <li>A page's performance is consistently bad. This is possibly a symptom of memory bloat. Memory bloat is when a
        page uses more memory than is necessary for optimal page speed.</li>
      <li>A page's performance is delayed or appears to pause frequently. This is possibly a symptom of frequent
        garbage
        collections. Garbage collection is when the browser reclaims memory. The browser decides when this happens.
        During collections, all script execution is paused. So if the browser is garbage collecting a lot, script
        execution is going to get paused a lot.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Task Manager</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Open the Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc).</li>
      <li>Click on the "Processes" tab.</li>
      <li>Look for the process that corresponds to your browser.</li>
      <li>Check the "Memory" column to see how much memory the browser is using.</li>
      <li>Click on the "Memory" column to sort the processes by memory usage.</li>
      <li>Look for any processes that are using an unusually high amount of memory.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These two columns tell you different things about how your page is using memory:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Memory footprint column represents OS memory. DOM nodes are stored in OS memory. If this value is
        increasing, DOM nodes are getting created.</li>
      <li>The JavaScript Memory column represents the JS heap. This column contains two values. The value you're
        interested in is the live number (the number in parentheses). The live number represents how much memory the
        reachable objects on your page are using. If this number is increasing, either new objects are being created, or
        the existing objects are growing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Memory Tool</h2>

    <h3>Shallow Size</h3>
    <p>Shallow size is the amount of memory allocated for an object itself, excluding the memory used by objects
      referenced by it. It represents the memory footprint of the object alone.</p>

    <h3>Retained Size</h3>
    <p>Retained size is the total memory size that will be freed when the object is garbage collected. It includes the
      shallow size of the object and the sizes of all objects that are only accessible through this object. Retained
      size helps in understanding the impact of an object on the overall memory usage.</p>

    <h3>Distance</h3>
    <p>Distance is a metric that indicates how far an object is from the root of the object graph. It represents the
      number of references that need to be traversed to reach the object from the root. A smaller distance means the
      object is closer to the root and more likely to be retained in memory, while a larger distance indicates the
      object is deeper in the object graph and more likely to be garbage collected.</p>
