  <p>
    Please create a minimal web server that serves an HTML page with an HTML canvas tag on it. On the canvas, you need
    to print an image. The image file is a text file that represents an image by RGBA Colors, which means that every 4
    values (separated by a comma) represent the color of one pixel. R, G, B and A can get a value between 0 to 255. The
    size of the image appears in the file name right after the dash sign. For example, if the file name is
    chuck-550x524.txt, the image width is 550px and the image height is 524px.

    There is a sample HTML file (index.html), with a script tag on it with a javascript code (index.js) that creates the
    canvas tag dynamically and prints a random image on it.

    Please note that the image file can be very large, maybe you can think of an optimization... And, please provide
    instructions on how to run the web server.

    Good Luck!
